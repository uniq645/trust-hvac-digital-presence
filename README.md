# 🛠️ Trust HVAC Services - High-Conversion Landing Page

## 🎯 The Mission

Most local service businesses (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical) suffer from "leaky bucket" websites which they spend money on ads but lose users due to poor UI/UX and slow load times.

**Trust HVAC** is a performance-optimized, SEO-ready landing page built specifically to solve this problem. It is designed to convert anonymous visitors into booked appointments using modern psychological triggers and a lightning-fast tech stack.

## 🚀 Key Features for Business Growth

- **Conversion-Optimized UI:** High-visibility "Call to Action" (CTA) buttons and lead capture forms positioned for maximum engagement.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Fully responsive architecture ensuring local technicians and customers can access the site on-the-go.
- **SEO Ready:** Semantic HTML5 and optimized metadata structure to help local businesses rank higher in local search results.
- **Performance:** Built with Vite for near-instant load times (crucial for lowering bounce rates and improving Google Quality Score).
- **Modern Styling:** Built using **shadcn/ui** and **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, professional aesthetic that builds instant brand trust.
